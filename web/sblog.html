  <h1>New study reveals Oxford coronavirus vaccine produces strong immune response</h1>

  <a><img alt="Oxford coronavirus vaccine" src="images/vacc.JPG" style="border: 5px solid ;border-radius:10px;padding:1px;margin:2%;"/></a>

  <h3>A team of scientists at Oxford University’s Jenner Institute and Oxford Vaccine Group
     has taken the next step towards the discovery of a safe, effective and accessible vaccine
      against coronavirus.</h3>

  <p>Our vaccine work is progressing quickly. To ensure you have the latest information or to
    find out more about the trial, please visit the<a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2020-07-20-new-study-reveals-oxford-coronavirus-vaccine-produces-strong-immune-response"target="_blank"> Oxford COVID-19 vaccine web hub</a>
    or visit the <a href="https://covid19vaccinetrial.co.uk/"target="_blank">COVID-19 trial website.</a></p>
  <p>The results of the Phase I/II trial published today in the scientific journal, The Lancet, indicate no early
     safety concerns and induces strong immune responses in both parts of the immune system.</p>
  <p>The vaccine provoked a T cell response within 14 days of vaccination (white blood cells that can attack cells infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus), and an antibody response within 28 days (antibodies are able to neutralise
     the virus so that it cannot infect cells when initially contracted).</p>


  <p>During the study participants who received the vaccine had detectable neutralising antibodies,
     which have been suggested by researchers as important for protection, and these responses were strongest after
     a booster dose, with 100% of participants' blood having neutralising activity against the coronavirus. The next
      step in studying the vaccine is to confirm that it can effectively protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.</p>
  <p>The University of Oxford is working with the UK-based global biopharmaceutical company AstraZeneca for the further development, large-scale
    manufacture and potential distribution of the Covid-19 vaccine, with plans for clinical development and production of the Oxford vaccine
    progressing globally. The project has been further spurred by £84 million of Government funding to help accelerate the vaccine’s development.</p>
  <p>“We are encouraged by the Phase I/II interim data showing AZD1222 was capable of generating a rapid antibody and T-cell response against
    SARS-CoV-2. While there is more work to be done, today’s data increases our confidence that the vaccine will work and allows us to continue our
     plans to manufacture the vaccine at scale for broad and equitable access around the world,” says Mene Pangalos, Executive Vice President of BioPharmaceuticals
      Research and Development at AstraZeneca.</p>
  <p>Oxford and AstraZeneca are collaborating with clinical partners around the world as part of a global clinical programme to trial the Oxford vaccine.
     The global programme is made up of a Phase III trial in the US enrolling 30,000 patients, a paediatric study, as well as Phase III trials
      in low-to-middle income countries including Brazil and South Africa which are already underway.</p>
  <p>AstraZeneca remain committed to fulfilling their commitment for broad and equitable access to the vaccine, should late-stage
    clinical trials prove successful. So far, commitments to supply more than 2 billion doses of the vaccine have been agreed with the
     UK, US, Europe’s Inclusive Vaccines Alliance (IVA), the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness (CEPI), Gavi the Vaccine Alliance and
     Serum Institute of India.</p>
  <p>Business Secretary Alok Sharma said: “Today’s results are extremely encouraging, taking us one step closer to finding
     a successful vaccine to protect millions in the UK and across the world. Backed by £84 million Government investment for
     the vaccine’s development and manufacture, the agility and speed with which the University of Oxford have been working is outstanding.
      I am very proud of what they have achieved so far.”</p>
  <p>Kate Bingham, Chair of the UK's Vaccine Taskforce said: “The UK is fortunate to have such
    outstanding academic innovators working alongside the highly experienced global team at AstraZeneca.
    This partnership is working at exceptional speed to demonstrate the safety and clinical effectiveness of the
    chadox vaccine in protecting people against COVID-19 infection.”</p>
